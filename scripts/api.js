"description": "Variegated Tiger Eye - Gemstone Guitar Pick\n30.54mm x 24.37mm and 1.49mm thick\n1 inch = 25.4 mm\nA nickel is = 21.20mm\nItem# E0311\n\nVariegated Tiger Eye Tiger&#39;s eye (also called Tigers eye or Tiger eye)  comes from Cape Province, South Africa is a chatoyant gemstone that is usually a metamorphic rock that is a golden to red-brown color, with a silky luster. A member of the quartz group, it is a classic example of pseudomorphous replacement by silica of fibrous crocidolite (blue asbestos) During the process, the asbestos is completely dissolved.  But The quartz takes on the fibrous formations and the blue color of crocidolite. This creates the parallel lines within the gem which gives it that ever shifting play of light and movement, the stone is so loved for.  This is also known as chatoyancy.  This gleam that rolls across its surface is much like the eyes of a cat.  A mixture of golden and blue color is referred to as Variegated Tiger Eye. \n\nGemstone picks will last a long time. The picks have a polished edge that allows the pick to glide across the guitar strings. \n\nAll pictures taken outdoors in sunlight and dry (sometimes people take pictures with the rock wet to show what they look like polish). Color may vary some from the original, but should be close.\nAll picks are hand made by me and only me! \n\nPlease read my policies to help answer any questions you have. Contact me if you have more questions.\n\nNote: Stone picks can BREAK!\nThe main concern for your stone picks long life is dropping it on tile or concrete floors. Also do not carry the guitar picks in your wallet or loose in your pocket with your keys or coins. Don&#39;t try to flex your pick , rocks don&#39;t flex they break.",

"title": "Could not pick a better dad bronze guitar pick",
"description": "Complete with a hand sawed heart for dad, this bronze guitar pick was cut from 20 gauge bronze and stamped one letter at a time with couldn&#39;t pick a better dad. You can personalize this pick for dad with any additional stamping, custom message, or exchange the heart for a different cut out by entering your requests in the notes to seller section during check out.\n\nThis bronze pick has hand filed edges and polished surfaces for a smooth glide and is ready to help dad master that tricky power slide for a little guitar voodoo. Measuring 1.3 inches long by 1.2 inches wide, the pick is my own unique design, but is similar in size to a standard plastic pick. Bronze and metal guitar picks offer a brighter tone and longer sustain versus plastic picks, while providing excellent rigidity and aesthetics. The text is darkened with a black patina for contrast and legibility against the golden glow of burnished bronze.\n\nCustom orders and special requests are always welcome. Since I make my own blank guitar picks, I can create picks in any shape, size, style, thickness and metal with your choice of designs. Guitar picks also make great bracelets and pendants. Please contact me any time with questions. Thanks.. Nici",

The pasty mixture will bubble, but will quickly settle down.\r\nUse a small piece of soft cloth to rub this paste onto your bronze piece. Rub until you&#39;re satisfied with the clean\r\n\r\n\r\nhow to clean copper : rub down with ketchup until sparkling clean and rinse with water , dry with soft cloth, not quite working? try mixing a bit of salt into the ketchup ( old cooking trick for copper pans and pots )\r\n\r\n\r\ni can also seal your pick with lacquer however you should not play your guitar with a sealed pick as the lacquer will get on the strings \r\n\r\nnici\r\n\r\nInternational buyers are responsible for all VAT, fees, and custom restrictions.

"title": "Synthrotek Rat Clone Distortion Kit - Wired Version with Case",
"description": "Now new and improved! Synthrotek&#39;s Wired Version of the classic RAT pedal goes well beyond a clone, in fact we have included 3 of the MOST POPULAR mods ON BOARD. Switching between these mods is very easy.\n\nThe Synthrotek RAT Distortion Pedal Clone Complete Kit gets you that classic gritty tone with a lot of options for your own! Despite being a clone, we&#39;ve designed these PCBs as close to the raved-about original with the most popular boutique pedal mods on-board.\n\nOur RAT kit comes in two different forms: Wired and PCB-Mount.  It&#39;s the same PCB for both kits, but each kit has slightly different components, different sized cases and a different Bill of Materials. \n\nYou can check out the PCB-Mount version here:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/202383795/synthrotek-rat-clone-distortion-kit-pcb\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- 4 controls - Volume, Drive, Filter, and R-Tone - to customize your tone. Volume sets the output level, Drive lets you determine the signal gain, Filter dials in the high frequency response, and R-Tone turns up your bass frequencies from clean to fuzzy grit.\n\n- DIP Switch Diode Clipping - On-board 4PST DIP Switch selects between 4 different clipping diodes to drastically alter your sound. Turn on the stock version 1N4148s, LEDs, Germanium diodes, or none at all with flick of a little switch. Tons of tweak!\n\n- PCB is designed the original RAT tone IC, the LM308 single op amp, for the vintage tone. The updated version of the RAT line of pedals uses an inferior-sounding OP07DP op amp IC. Get the vintage tone!\n\n- 3PDT switch layout allows for an easy wiring job, with true bypass switching and LED indicator to give you a visual cue when your RAT Distortion Pedal Clone circuit is engaged and using power.\n\n- Dual power supplies (9V Battery and +9VDC =&gt;200mA Center Negative DC Adapter Power  -Supplies) allow you to have the battery as backup or as the main power. (AC Adapter not included.)\n\n- Input jack switching - No instrument cable plugged in, no power used. Save life on your expensive batteries!\n\n- PCB silkscreen, through-hole components with careful on-board placement, and wire-tension relief holes were designed with the DIYer in mind!\n\n- Comes with a pre-drilled 1590BB case.\n\n- PCB Dimensions: 2.125&quot; x 3.25&quot;\n\n\n\nGuides:\n\nCheck out the Assembly Instructions here:\nhttp://www.synthrotek.com/kit-assembly-instructions/effect-pedals-assembly-instructions/rat-clone-assembly-instructions/wired-rat-clone/\n\nAnd the Bill of Materials (BOM) here:\nhttp://www.synthrotek.com/kit-assembly-instructions/effect-pedals-assembly-instructions/rat-clone-assembly-instructions/wired-rat-clone/wired-rat-clone-bom/\n\nAnd the schematic:\nhttp://www.synthrotek.com/products/effect-pedal-circuits/rat-clone/rat-schematic/\n\n\n\nVideo:\n\nHere&#39;s a rad video by Chris Benson of Benson Amplification on a complete RAT:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGPulsG8DnY",

"title": "Handmade Acoustic Parlor Guitar",
"description": "This is a custom built persimmon guitar. Persimmon is known as domestic ebony wood. The density is similar and the true center or heart of the tree is black like exotic varieties typically used to make fret boards and bridges. The rest of the log has a variety of interesting patterns and displays of marble like character. Can you tell I do this for the love of the wood? Not only did I bend the sides and cut a book-matched set for the back of this instrument from persimmon, I used a speckled section of the board to make the fret board for the guitar, the bridge, and the truss rod cover. I also went another step and laminated the head stock to match the back with you guessed it, persimmon. The neck is carved by hand from walnut, too, making this truly a domestic acoustic guitar. The top is made from slow growth Sitka Spruce from Washington and it does have a couple of bear claw markings.  It is braced inside with hand scalloped and shaped basswood and the kerfing was also hewn in my shop from mulberry. The joint at the upper bout is supported with a walnut block and the neck is also connected via a dovetail joint in walnut. One more note to add, its scale length is affectionately known as &quot;Martin Short&quot; which is the 24.9&quot; scale. \n\nBeyond the wood, this piece sports Grover Sta-tite 18:1 ratio open geared machine heads with butter bean knobs, medium nickel frets, and chrome strap buttons. It stays in tune very well. It has a good voluminous sound for a guitar of its size. It has abalone shell 1/4 &quot; marking dots on the fret board and white nut, bridge pins, and an aged compensated saddle. \n\nGot questions about this item, send me a message. Want to see pictures of it &quot;in traction&quot; as it was being built, I have a few. Custom orders are welcome. If you would like to see an instrument made for you with your favorite thing cut out for sound holes, or like cedar or some other kind or color of wood, no problem. You should, however, expect a minimum of two to three weeks for your custom instrument to be completed. \n\nLive locally and wish to save on shipping, message me and hand delivery can be arranged. Each item is unique in its own regard and since I do not make things from a template, no two will be exactly alike.  \n\nI have several other heirloom quality one of a kind toys and gifts for sale, so please check out my other items, visit my facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/EdwardsToysandGifts) or my website (http://www.edwardstoysandgifts.com/)! You are sure to find something for your own inner child or one you know. New items added as completed, but items that have sold out or are no longer in stock can be viewed there and give you ideas for a request. For something special, contact me via message. My products feature hardwoods felled and harvested from Middle Tennessee that have been sawn locally by small lumber mills and most products are accented with exotic species from around the world.",

"title": "Hand crafted playable miniature 6 string guitar",
"description": "I started this project with the idea that if someone out there had a very young, or very small middle school aged child that had some interest in learning to play and was struggling with a larger full or parlor sized guitar, that this would be a cool alternative. It is also more accommodating to have a ukulele sized instrument if you travel and wanted to take a guitar with you, but did not have the room for a regular sized one. \r\n\r\nIt is made from solid, one-piece body and neck construction with matching walnut back. The endgrain view around the sides of the instrument resembles burl somewhat in places due to the angle of the cuts. The top is Spanish cedar with hand carved walnut bridge in the shape of an eagle, sporting aged bridge pins and modified compensated saddle that looks like it is being grasped in the talons. The fret board is inlaid into the top.The headstock is laminated with persimmon to match the fret board. I also included a side view, hopefully it can be enlarged to show the action height. This is built on a ukulele frame with a standard 13 and 7/8&quot; scale and strung with light Extra Slinky Ernie Ball strings for acoustic guitars. No strap buttons have been installed, but could be for another $10 (the cost of chrome buttons). \r\n\r\nHear this instrument played here: (http://youtu.be/wy0cptBCJtY)\r\n\r\nGot questions about this item, send me a message. Custom orders are welcome. If you would like to see a instrument made for you with your favorite thing cut out for sound holes, or like some other kind or color of wood, no problem. You should, however, expect a minimum of two to three weeks for your custom instrument to be completed.   \r\n\r\nLive locally and wish to save on shipping, message me and hand delivery can be arranged. Each item is unique in its own regard and since I do not make things from a template, no two will be alike.  \r\n\r\nI have several other heirloom quality one of a kind toys and gifts for sale, so please check out my other items, visit my facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/EdwardsToysandGifts) or my website (http://www.edwardstoysandgifts.com/)!

"description": "This is a custom built mandolin with cherry backs and sides and top. The fret board is wenge on a maple riser set up for fast action down the entire length of the instrument. The bridge, of course is height adjustable and  floats in front of a black tailpiece with scroll work inscribed. I have drawn on some embossed scrolls onto the body of the instrument in brown to complement the natural warm tone of the wood. The outer sections of the tree were positioned near the center of the soundboard to assit in the transfer of vibrations from the edges of the instrument to the center, where they can be released through the soundhole. It is signed inside and inscribed, &quot;May your grass always be blue . . .&quot; It is a unique one of a kind piece. \r\n\r\nBeyond the wood, this piece sports 15:1 ratio open geared machine heads with ivoroid knobs, medium nickel frets, and black strap buttons.  \r\n\r\nGot questions about this item, send me a message. Want to see pictures of it &quot;in traction&quot; as it was being built, I have a few. Custom orders are welcome. If you would like to see an instrument made for you with your favorite thing cut out for sound holes, or like cedar or some other kind or color of wood, no problem. You should, however, expect a minimum of two to three weeks for your custom instrument to be completed. \r\n\r\nLive locally and wish to save on shipping, message me and hand delivery can be arranged. Each item is unique in its own regard and since I do not make things from a template, no two will be exactly alike.  \r\n\r\nI have several other heirloom quality one of a kind toys and gifts for sale, so please check out my other items, visit my facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/EdwardsToysandGifts) or my website (http://www.edwardstoysandgifts.com/)!

"title": "Hand crafted 6 string cigar box guitar",
"description": "This is a &quot;ACID&quot; cigar box, ultimately square and almost cubicle. I inlaid an inset cut for the saddle and filed away relief for the strings to set. The neck is milled from mahogany and the fret board is made from poplar, then died to appear ebony. It hosts medium nickel frets and ends at a cherry nut leading to Grover 1:1 ukulele pegs. The strings are &quot;bridged through a custom designed poplar end-piece that I also milled a cap for so I could cover the string holes. You can see it removed in one of the pics (number 2). I string these with nylon as metal strings apply simply too much down force on most cigar boxes in my opinion and they will stay in tune better. The neck of it does not continue across the top, thus it can be opened, just not while is is strung up. I did not drill a hole in the body of the box, but doing so would increase its volume. You can ask me to drill a hole when you order if you prefer it to be louder when played. \r\n\r\nThese things are cool, and they are an interesting conversation starter, but up front, this are not intended to be instrument replacements. While you could and should play one, because they can be tuned, if you set it on a shelf for a couple weeks and come back to it, you will need to tune it again. The Grover uke pegs are 1:1 (not geared) so they work best if the string wraps around the left side of the peg if you are looking at the top of the headstock. The tuners are set with screws behind the instrument, you get it to where you want it and then tighten the screw. Tension on the shaft from the string, when it is pulling on it in the direction that the screw is turned to tighten it helps the instrument to stay in tune longer. Tension the other way will result in the tension working against the stability of the screw which hold the guitar in tune.  \r\n\r\nGot questions about this item, send me a message. Custom orders are welcome. If you would like to see a instrument made for you with your favorite thing cut out for sound holes, or like some other kind or color of wood, no problem. You should, however, expect a minimum of two to three weeks for your custom instrument to be completed.   \r\n\r\nLive locally and wish to save on shipping, message me and hand delivery can be arranged. Each item is unique in its own regard and since I do not make things from a template, no two will be alike.  \r\n\r\nI have several other heirloom quality one of a kind toys and gifts for sale, so please check out my other items, visit my facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/EdwardsToysandGifts) or my website (http://www.edwardstoysandgifts.com/)! You are sure to find something for your own inner child or one you know. New items added as completed, but items that have sold out or are no longer in stock can be viewed there and give you ideas for a request. For something special, contact me via message. My products feature hardwoods felled and harvested from Middle Tennessee that have been sawn locally by small lumber mills and most products are accented with exotic species from around the world.\r\n\r\nSome of my photos were taken by Curtis Beard, local photographer, check out his Facebook page here:\r\n(https://www.facebook.com/curtis.beard.37?fref=ts)",

Each design in your order will be sent in a separate email.  We use the email address provided in your etsy profile.  Please make sure this is current.  If you do not see the files in your email – check your junk or spam folder.  If you STILL do not see our emails – send us a convo and we will work on getting the files over to you.  Currently, we do not have a way to automate the super sets where you pick “x” amount of sets.  Those files will usually be emailed to you within 24 hours – unless it is a weekend order.  Our working hours on the weekend are limited due to spending time with our family.  If you need IMMEDIATE instant download, you can order from our main website – www.embroitique.com .\r\n\r\nFORMATS:\r\nDST - EXP - JEF - HUS - PES - SEW - SHV - VIP - VP3 - XXX. These are a few of the most popular formats. If you are unsure of the file type needed, or do not see the type for your machine listed please contact us BEFORE purchasing your items. The license for the design you are purchasing is for ONE format for use one ONE machine.  If you selected the wrong format by accident – no worries, we will help you get the proper format.  Again, if you have questions – just ask!  Here is a helpful guide for the type of format needed for some of the machines on the market:\r\n\r\n\r\nBabyLock                    PES\r\nBernina                       ART for Artista 440 and below; EXP for Artista 630 and up, and Deco 340. EXP or  \r\n                                      ART for Artista 730; ART or PES for Deco 330.  \r\n                ***please note**** \r\nEmbroitique does not offer designs in ART format, however we have had conversations with Bernina representatives, and they suggest using EXP.  However, we cannot support the Integrity of designs converted and/or altered with software that we do not support.\r\r\nBrother                        PES (Innovis, ULT, and PR-600 models also take DST)\r\nHusqvarna Viking   VIP for Platinum and SE; HUS for Rose, Iris, and Designer II; VIP, HUS, or DST for \r\n                                     Diamond. SHV for Designer I; VP3 for Topaz. \r\nJanome                       JEF for 12000, 11000, 10001, 10000, 9700, 9500, 350, 300. JEF or DST for MB4.  \r\n                                     SEW for 9000 and below.\r\nPfaff                              PCS for older machines, VIP for newer machines such as the Creative Vision\r\nSinger                          XXX for most models\r\n\r\nSIZING:\r\nFor monogram sets, the size of the set is based off of the Capital A in the alphabet.  Each letter is sized proportionately to that letter, and will often times be larger than the size of the alphabet.  For instance, a cursive capital Y have a tail that falls below the baseline of the letter, and would be larger than the capital A.  Single design size label is based on height OR width of the design – but will be consistent for each specific design (example, for tall/narrow designs we will base the sizing off of the height of each design.  For designs that are wider, we will size according to width.  If you have questions, just ask!  That is what we are here for!\r\n\r\nCD&#39;S:\r\nWe no longer offer CD&#39;s. We simply do not have the bandwidth to create CD’s at this time..\r\n\r\nPlease note – these are digitized embroidery designs and monogram fonts. They are not patches that you sew on. You must have an embroidery machine to work with these files and a way to transfer the files from your computer to your embroidery machine - (usb, memory card, cd, etc.). With the monogram alphabets/fonts each letter is a separate design and you must layer or merge the designs together to create names or words. If the software that you are working with doesn&#39;t allow you to merge multiple designs together – you may need additional software to utilize these sets. We are happy to recommend software to use if needed. We DO NOT support files that have been saved into a format that is not offered and we cannot test. Designs that have been re-sized will not be supported. Re-sizing a file MAY compromise the integrity of the design. \r\n\r\nREFUNDS:\r\nDue to the digital nature of our business, we do not offer refunds for designs received.  All sales are final.

Each and every item from Three Little Pixies is made with love and personalized by *me* for *you!*  It is a privilege to create your custom, one-of-a-kind, keepsake piece. \r\n\r\nEtsy can be a little tricky to navigate and each shop here is independently owned, so I would like to confirm a few important details about my shop with you. \r\n\r\n❤ My current production time is up to ❤ 7-10 BUSINESS DAYS ❤ with the exception of our stacking birthstone rings which are 2-3 WEEKS and our custom handwriting and artwork pieces which can take up to FOUR WEEKS. This is the time that I devote to creating your special keepsake. Please keep in mind that each item is HAND MADE. No machinery is involved. I do strive to get your special item to you sooner but feel it necessary to say it may take up to the full TEN BUSINESS DAYS to complete your item especially during busy holiday seasons. \r\n\r\n❤ This does not include shipping time from me to you.

These are not considered defects and add to the charm and individuality of your items. Pendants are hand stamped. At times the letters won&#39;t line up completely straight or entirely. This is not a imperfection but part of the piece&#39;s CHARM, INDIVIDUALITY and UNIQUENESS.  Rest assured I would not send out anything that I would not wear with pride myself!\r\n\r\nPlease contact me before leaving feedback and we will work together to find a resolution. I provide full refunds or exchanges for non-personalized items that are returned in their original condition. Return shipping costs are the buyer’s responsibility. Contact must be made within (3) days of package receipt in order  to request a return on a non-personalized piece.",
"policy_additional": "♥:{ Turnaround Time for Your Custom Piece }:♥\r\nPlease feel free to contact me BEFORE your purchase for current turnaround time. \r\n\r\nI make every effort to create your item within 3 weeks after payment has cleared. This is the time it takes BEFORE your item is ready to ship. This does not include shipping time over which I have no control. During periods of heavy volume, such as holidays or large storewide sales, this time may be increased. \r\n\r\nPlease remember your custom piece of jewelry is created by hand. I am not a factory nor am I an assembly line. I am only one person (sometimes two as my darling husband handles the shipping!) creating, emailing, packing and shipping orders.  \r\n\r\nI am a only a convo away should you have any questions or concerns!\r\n\r\n♥:{ Product Information}:♥\r\nAll charm jewelry created by Three Little Pixies is made with the finest metals available. Unless otherwise specified all jewelry items are made with sterling silver, copper or brass. Upon request your item can be made from gold filled discs. THESE ARE NOT GOLD PLATED. Plating is a process where the base metal is covered with gold or silver to give the look of the real thing but the process will inevitably cause flaking and breakthrough. Filling, on the other hand is an actual layer of gold-pressure bonded to another metal. It contains more gold than gold plated and is much more valuable and tarnish resistant.  Gold filled items will not flake off, rub off or turn colors. Anyone who can wear gold, can wear gold filled without worry of allergic reaction. With proper care it will last as long as 14K gold.\r\n\r\nIf plated components are used in any item it will be disclosed in the listing. The gold or silver in plated items can eventually wear thin if it comes into constant contact with the wearer&#39;s skin and friction. Therefore I do not recommend, and do not warranty your piece, if you sleep, swim, shower, or exercise in your jewelry.\r\n\r\nEach piece is hand stamped by me using individual stamping tools. Every single letter, number or design is stamped by ME one at a time on your piece. Because of this please note that NO two pieces will be exactly the same. Letters, Numbers, Designs, etc.  may not be perfectly straight or aligned and spacing may vary. These should not be looked at as imperfections but  as what makes your piece YOURS ALONE and ONE OF A KIND. \r\n\r\nDarkening may vary depending on the depth of the stamp and may fade over time. This is a natural process when wearing fine metal.\r\n\r\nWe use a petite sterling silver rolo chain when creating our jewelry. Prices include necklaces up to 18&quot;. If you would like a 20&quot; chain for an additional $5 please be sure to leave a note in the message to seller field or contact me for a custom listing. 1 mm sterling silver ball chain is also available as an upgrade. 16&quot; and 18&quot; necklaces are a $15 up charge. Contact me prior to checkout and I&#39;ll adjust the listing for you!\r\n\r\n♥:{Cancellation Requests}:♥ Please note that clicking &quot;Request Cancel&quot; on your order DOES NOT automatically cancel your order. The button will simply submit a REQUEST for your cancellation. Please be sure of your purchase prior to submitting your order as TLP will NOT honor cancellation requests made after your purchase is completed.\r\n\r\n♥:{Warranty Information}:♥\r\nAll components of your necklace are under warranty for 45 days from the date of purchase. Should your jump rings loosen or chains break from normal wear and tear during this time frame we will replace them for you free of charge. After that period there will be a minimal fee to replace broken/loosened components. Pieces sent back for repair will be inspected, polished and all components checked and tightened before being returned. \r\n \r\n♥:{Gift Packaging}:♥\r\nAll items come boxed and ready for gift giving. If you would like to send it directly to your recipient please by sure to update the address the item is to be sent to when you check out through Paypal. Also, feel free to let me know if you would like me to enclose a gift card! :o)\r\n\r\n♥:{Safety Information}:♥\r\nPLEASE ALSO NOTE that all jewelry sold by Three Little Pixies Boutique is not intended for children under the age of 12.  When giving our products to young children and toddlers please make sure that they are fully supervised to prevent accidental choking on the small pieces.\r\n\r\n♥:{Care of Your Three Little Pixies Jewelry}:♥\r\nDue to the metals natural reaction with both the environment and your body oils, it will tarnish over time and require a tiny bit of upkeep. Here are some tips to keep your jewelry looking it&#39;s BEST and BRAND NEW.\r\n\r\n* DO NOT wear when using Body Sprays, Perfumes, Hair Spray or Household Products. Your jewelry should be put on AFTER you&#39;ve applied or come into contact with these items.\r\n\r\n* DO NOT clean silver with cleaning dips, polishes or liquids. This will cause the removal of the darkening in the letters. The best way to care for your piece is to use a piece of polishing cloth and gently rub it to remove the tarnish.\r\n\r\n* If you are not wearing your piece, store it in an air tight container or zip lock bag.\r\n\r\n♥:{We LOVE Custom Orders!}:♥\r\nFeel free to contact us for wholesale pricing, consignment or quantity discounts.  \r\nxoxo\r\nLiz",

I also POST SAMPLES OF EACH PATTERN and buyers finished pieces (when sent), all these patterns cannot be sewn because of the number for sale. These designs are computer generated. The number of colors can be increased, but on the more elaborate patterns this can run into hundreds of colors if left as original first conversion and also will be costly for threads. \r\n\r\nI will send your pattern with the full number of colors or higher amount at request. \r\nThank You.\r\n\r\nWe also offer an extensive assortment of other subjects.

But I do my best to make them as close to those measurements as I can. I do this by hand and I have to estimate as I sand them by hand. \n\nQ. CAN YOU ACTUALLY PLAY WITH THESE?\nA: Yes, I practice guitar and use them on my acoustic guitar. Wood guitar picks offer a much clearer and stronger strum. It gives a very earthy tone. You’ll hear and notice it when you try it. \n\nFeel and sound:\n\nFor sound,\nThey make a great smooth sound when they hit the strings. It doesn&#39;t have that plasticky sound that a plastic pick has as it rolls off each string. Customers and friends say that they have a beautiful earthy tone.\n\nFor feel,\nSmooth to the touch, great grip at the top. It&#39;s hard to see in the pictures, but there are indentations at the top on both sides for gripping. Engravings add some roughness but give more friction to make it even easier to grip.\n\nCheck to see pictures of the indentations for the grip at the top of the pick at my about page:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/PickslaysWoodworking/about?ref=l2-about\n\n\n\n\n[DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLASTIC AND WOOD PICKS]\n\n\n&gt;Wood has no flexibility and is very firm.\n&gt; Wood offers a much clearer and stronger strum\n&gt; It doesn&#39;t have that plastic plucking sound that most plastic picks have as the pick catches on every string. \n&gt; It gives a very earthy tone.\n\n\n*grain patterns will vary from pick to pick, \nthe above picture is a stock photo,\nhowever, other picks will compare in quality, color, and grain pattern\n\nThanks for looking,\nSpencer",

"policy_refunds": "My customers’ satisfaction is of utmost importance to me. I truly appreciate all my positive reviews. However, any time an issue arises, I want my customers to give me the opportunity to make it right before leaving negative feedback so please contact me for any issues!. I want you to be 100% happy with your order.\r\nIf you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, you can exchange it or receive a refund (minus the shipping!). Buyer pays return shipping. \r\n\r\n***THE REFUND IT&#39;S NOT ISSUED FOR A PERSONALIZED ORDER THAT HAS BEEN MADE WRONG BECAUSE OF AN INCORRECT INFO NOTE THAT I&#39;VE RECEIVED FROM THE BUYER. Like a wrong date, names, messages or coordinates!\r\n\r\nThis shop sells only handmade items. I invest time, passion and care into each creation to make one-of-a-kind, unique pieces. Most can be customized; just ask! Mistakes in customization are very rare because of my attention to detail, but if should this occur, I’ll always make it right. Be confident in your purchase with me!\r\n\r\nCancellations\r\n\r\nShould you wish to cancel your order, you must do so within 24 hours from the time your order was placed. I want to send your order as quickly as possible, so you’ll need to let me know quickly if you’ve changed your mind. Any cancellations after this time will not be refunded.\r\n\r\nFor further understanding about my policies, please review these additional points:\r\n\r\n*1. SHIPPING DELAYS: My Shipping Policy provides the typical transit times established by USPS and other national postal services. Please be aware that inclement weather and natural disasters in the customer’s country/state/region, while rare, do cause delays for which I cannot be held responsible.\r\n\r\nShould your item be delayed in these circumstances, I cannot issue a refund. As my Shipping Policy indicates, your order will always have a tracking number, so we can work together to find out where it is at any given time. I can not prevent or predict any kind of delays and I can&#39;t be responsible for that! Postal services actions are not under my control but for lost we can work together to find the best solution for you( check the point *3).\r\n\r\n*2. DAMAGED IN TRANSIT: If an order is damaged in shipping process, please provide photographic proof, and I will issue a full refund, including the shipping fee, OR I will resend your order at my cost (the resend is more convenient for me).\r\n\r\n*3. LOST IN TRANSIT: “Lost orders” are defined as an order with a tracking number that have not been updated with a location status change for more than 3 weeks. I will issue a full refund, including the shipping fee, OR I will resend your order at my cost (the resend is more convenient for me.)\r\n\r\n*4. INCORRECT SHIPPING ADDRESS: I am not responsible for an incorrect or incomplete address provided to me that causes the order to be returned to me. No refunds will be issued in this circumstance.\r\n\r\n*5. DELIVERY SIGNATURE: To ensure your order reaches you, as my Shipping Policy states, I always add signature confirmation. Should your order be returned to me because you did not sign for the item in the allotted time by your postal service, I am not responsible. No refunds will be issued. Please check your tracking number in anticipation of receiving your order to avoid this situation.\r\n\r\n*6. ITEMS AS DESCRIBED: I go to great lengths to textually and photographically describe the items in my store so you can see exactly what you’re purchasing. Please note, there are usually photos from many angles, etc. to give you a great idea of the dimensions of the item. Have a question about dimensions? Just ask! I’ll be happy to provide you with more detail, should you require it. \r\n\r\nI don&#39;t have fake or adjusted/modified pictures and all are depicted as realistically as possible.\r\n\r\n*7. RING SIZING: The sized rings and the adjustable rings are always made *exactly* as it is chosen by you in order. For a sized ring, you need to be 100% sure of your size required. I am a professional jeweler using jeweler-quality sizing tools for 100% accuracy.\r\n\r\nRing sizing gauges and finger gauges as well as published charts do not always agree.\r\nPlease make certain you are ordering the size you will need!\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t know your US ring size, just contact me and I&#39;ll help you to find it. \r\n\r\nThe adjustable rings are more versatile as they can be made with -2/+2 sizes adjusted and are more suitable for gifts.\r\n\r\n*8. HOW TO FIND YOUR TRACKING NUMBER INFO: When your order is sent and the tracking number is issued, you will receive 2 emails: one from Etsy and one from Paypal. \r\n\r\nTo ensure that you see all updates of your tracking number, the BEST way is just to copy your tracking number and then paste it in your national postal service online page at tracking number section. \r\n\r\n",

"policy_seller_info": " I&#39;m the most optimistic person I know :))\r\nI can say that I am, perhaps, an overly optimistic woman, and I love everything that is beautiful and natural. I&#39;m always surrounded by people with beautiful souls, and I live in a small corner of paradise.\r\n\r\nI live for the spark in the eyes of a child, I love the bark of trees, I admire the flight of a butterfly, and I marvel at the wonderful colors of flowers, and yes, I&#39;m still a child in my heart...\r\nI&#39;m Manuela :)\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve always liked to create little things and to offer them fondly, aiming to &quot;steal&quot; a smile :)\r\nAt the age of four years I learned to sew my first button which was missing from my father&#39;s shirt. I was so happy... and at 12 years old, I already had a rich collection of little things that I had designed, cut and sewn, crocheted or woven.\r\nAfter I finished high school, I started playing with silver plated wires and semi-precious stones. \r\nI got my first real lessons of fine jewelry from an older jeweler with whom I became friends at a handmade fair. Everything that followed was a natural progression, not only in my career as a professional jeweler but in my private life, also. I have 5 kids and a wonderful hubby.\r\nI opened my own workshop at home and I decided then, after 9 years of various experiences, failures and accomplishments in the wonderful realm of jewelry creation, to open my first online shop, here. \r\n\r\nI just love to customize little things for each customer, and I love knowing that each carefully crafted piece will come to my customer&#39;s door with a small part of my life&#39;s memories. My own spirit even. It may seem exaggerated or cheesy, but I tell you: it&#39;s true. Everything is done only by hand without too many complex machines. My tools are simple and they have a story too :) But I can guarantee that they execute the best quality a handmade item may have, with, of course, a touch of uniqueness that all handmade goods possess. I&#39;m thrilled to have customers who value the journey of the product as much as the product itself.\r\n\r\nWhen you buy from an independent artist you are buying more than just a painting or a novel or a song. You are buying hundreds of hours of experimentation and thousands of failures. You are buying days, weeks, months, years of frustration and moments of pure joy. You are buying nights of worry about paying the rent, having enough money to eat, having enough money to feed the children, the birds, the dogs. You aren&#39;t just buying a THING, you are buying a piece of heart, a part of soul, a private moment in someone&#39;s life. Most important you are buying that artist more time to do something they are truly passionate about: something that makes all of the above worth the fear and all the doubt: something that puts the life into the living.\r\n\r\nby Rebekah Joy Plett\r\n",

Please let us know if you would prefer a non-signature-required option.\r\n\r\nFEEDBACK POLICY: \r\nWith the recent changes in Etsy&#39;s Feedback Policy, we are no longer able to leave you feedback... and deeply apologize as this was important for many of our customers.\r\n\r\nIn addition, due to the changes, any feedback you leave for my shop will be public and your Etsy profile will be attached.

(Really)\r\n\r\nOrders are not insured. If you would prefer to have your package insured against loss or damage, please let me know me and request insured shipping and I will send you a PayPal invoice for the difference. \r\n\r\nIn Canada, I use Canada Post.\r\n\r\nIf you do not receive your order in a reasonable amount of time, please contact me and I will discuss it with you. If it has been more than 3 weeks since your order shipped, it&#39;s likely that I will re-send it. \r\n\r\nShipping Times:\r\nWithin Canada: 2 to 8 Business Days\r\nUSA: 4 to 10 Business Days\r\nInternational: Depending on the country it can take 2 to 6 weeks\r\n\r\nBuyers are responsible for any duty or custom charges if applicable.\r\n\r\nAnd… please, please get your address right. Sounds crazy but it happens. I cannot be responsible for incorrect addresses. No… really!\r\n\r\nThe shipping charge includes not only the postage on your envelope, but also packaging (bubble envelope, bags, and other protective wrapping necessary), etc... as well as the transport down to the US border (8 hours away).\r\n\r\nPlease note:\r\nI have recently had a number of cases where I have sent out orders paid by eCheck that have subsequently bounced. \r\n\r\nAs a result, in most cases (unless you are a long time client), I will wait until the eCheck clears before sending your order. Please don&#39;t get upset with Sparky and I... we can&#39;t force PayPal to move any faster... ",
"policy_refunds": "Please check the items when your order arrives. If there are any discrepancies, please notify me within 5 days so that I can take corrective action. \r\n\r\nIf the problem is because I messed up (yikes) – incorrect description, wrong item shipped or major flaw, then you can return it for a full refund.\r\n\r\nHowever, please contact me before sending anything back.\r\n\r\nIf there is no problem with the item received, (you just don&#39;t want it it), shipping, handling, and insurance fees are NOT refundable and you are responsible for return shipping cost. As mentioned previously, you must contact me within 5 days of receiving your order.\r\n\r\nImportant note: All returned products must be in their original condition. I will issue a credit to your PayPal account after I receive the returned products. You will receive a refund for the item less the shipping costs paid.\r\n\r\nCANCELLATIONS:\r\nIf you must cancel your order, please notify us by CONVO only. If it hasn&#39;t shipped out we are happy to cancel and refund you. Please note that if you paid with PayPal we will not refund the .30 fee they charge for the transaction.\r\n\r\n",

"description": "This piece entitled &quot;Soulful Terrain&quot; is handmade from hard maple, maple veneer, brass, steel and aluminum. Treated with a process I call wood tattooing because of the appearance of the end result. Not so much the process. As with all my pieces, I do not strive for perfection. I strive for honesty. Truth. Much like the people in our lives and ourselves. No one is perfect. Accepting the imperfections is what makes everyone and everything beautiful in its own way. \n\nThis piece will bring this same feeling to your home, office or studio. Wherever you live. Wherever you create. \n\nThanks for looking! Have a great day!\nPB",
