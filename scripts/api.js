I&#39;m always surrounded by people with beautiful souls, and I live in a small corner of paradise.\r\n\r\nI live for the spark in the eyes of a child, I love the bark of trees, I admire the flight of a butterfly, and I marvel at the wonderful colors of flowers, and yes, I&#39;m still a child in my heart...\r\nI&#39;m Manuela :)\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve always liked to create little things and to offer them fondly, aiming to &quot;steal&quot; a smile :)\r\nAt the age of four years I learned to sew my first button which was missing from my father&#39;s shirt. I was so happy... and at 12 years old, I already had a rich collection of little things that I had designed, cut and sewn, crocheted or woven.\r\nAfter I finished high school, I started playing with silver plated wires and semi-precious stones. \r\nI got my first real lessons of fine jewelry from an older jeweler with whom I became friends at a handmade fair. Everything that followed was a natural progression, not only in my career as a professional jeweler but in my private life, also. I have 5 kids and a wonderful hubby.\r\nI opened my own workshop at home and I decided then, after 9 years of various experiences, failures and accomplishments in the wonderful realm of jewelry creation, to open my first online shop, here. \r\n\r\nI just love to customize little things for each customer, and I love knowing that each carefully crafted piece will come to my customer&#39;s door with a small part of my life&#39;s memories. My own spirit even. It may seem exaggerated or cheesy, but I tell you: it&#39;s true. Everything is done only by hand without too many complex machines. My tools are simple and they have a story too :) But I can guarantee that they execute the best quality a handmade item may have, with, of course, a touch of uniqueness that all handmade goods possess. I&#39;m thrilled to have customers who value the journey of the product as much as the product itself.\r\n\r\nWhen you buy from an independent artist you are buying more than just a painting or a novel or a song. You are buying hundreds of hours of experimentation and thousands of failures. You are buying days, weeks, months, years of frustration and moments of pure joy. You are buying nights of worry about paying the rent, having enough money to eat, having enough money to feed the children, the birds, the dogs. You aren&#39;t just buying a THING, you are buying a piece of heart, a part of soul, a private moment in someone&#39;s life. Most important you are buying that artist more time to do something they are truly passionate about: something that makes all of the above worth the fear and all the doubt: something that puts the life into the living.\r\n\r\nby Rebekah Joy Plett\r\n","policy_updated_tsz":1426968126,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/giftforbestfriends?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/056\/0\/7679031\/iusb_760x100.15205975_szgg.jpg","num_favorers":7467,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null}},{"listing_id":227857277,"state":"active","user_id":63859975,"category_id":69152791,"title":"Self-adhesive or Waterslide Guitar Headstock Logo Decal Fender Stratocaster Strat","description":"Available in Waterslide form or *Self-adhesive Permanent Clear Vinyl form (Not Waterslide), both are waterproof\/no smear.

I am not a machine, nor do I have a machine or factory that does the work for me. I personally handle each piece from start to finish. Due to the techniques used with hand stamping metal, the back of your piece will not look pristine. I will do my very best to ensure that the front of your piece is perfect. However, when there are multiple items on a chain or key ring, rubbing together of these items will cause some scratching. It adds to the character and charm of each piece. \r\n\r\nAlso, spacing, depth and alignment will vary slightly. I never send anything out that I wouldn&#39;t be proud to give to my family or friends or wear myself. I take a lot of pride in my work, and it is intended to be enjoyed. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy making it for you. \r\n\r\nNOTE: I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TO WORK FOR RUDE OR ABUSIVE CLIENTS.

The pasty mixture will bubble, but will quickly settle down.\r\nUse a small piece of soft cloth to rub this paste onto your bronze piece. Rub until you&#39;re satisfied with the clean\r\n\r\n\r\nhow to clean copper : rub down with ketchup until sparkling clean and rinse with water , dry with soft cloth, not quite working? try mixing a bit of salt into the ketchup ( old cooking trick for copper pans and pots )\r\n\r\n\r\ni can also seal your pick with lacquer however you should not play your guitar with a sealed pick as the lacquer will get on the strings \r\n\r\nnici\r\n\r\nInternational buyers are responsible for all VAT, fees, and custom restrictions.

The pasty mixture will bubble, but will quickly settle down.\r\nUse a small piece of soft cloth to rub this paste onto your bronze piece. Rub until you&#39;re satisfied with the clean\r\n\r\n\r\nhow to clean copper : rub down with ketchup until sparkling clean and rinse with water , dry with soft cloth, not quite working? try mixing a bit of salt into the ketchup ( old cooking trick for copper pans and pots )\r\n\r\n\r\ni can also seal your pick with lacquer however you should not play your guitar with a sealed pick as the lacquer will get on the strings \r\n\r\nnici\r\n\r\nInternational buyers are responsible for all VAT, fees, and custom restrictions.

If you want your package shipped to a different address please make that change when you place your order. Buyer is responsible for any additional shipping fees. If package is returned to me, you will have to pay additional shipping fees to have it redelivered to a new address. \r\n\r\n\u2022 If your tracking information confirms delivery but you did not receive it, you must go to your local post office and file a claim.
