"policy_payment": "I take all major credit cards and paypal as a sufficient payment. I often will trade my products for another shop owner&#39;s products but I always follow the Etsy rules regarding this. Convo me for more details if you are unsure how this works. Since you found me on Etsy, please do not ask if I will send you a paypal invoice or go around Etsy. That is called fee avoidance and my shop could be terminated and I would kick my self into oblivion if that ever happened; so save yourself the time :-)\r\n\r\n",

IF YOU PURCHASE PRIORITY or EXPRESS, you get $50 FREE INSURANCE. It&#39;s well worth it, in my opinion. Plus...a little better packaging. \r\n\r\nI don&#39;t provide insurance for your package but if you would like to purchase it, please let me know ASAP or just choose priority as your shipping option. \r\n\r\nI also send a shipment confirmation with every single package I ship along with tracking information. Etsy automatically sends this for me to the e-mail address you provide on your Etsy account as soon as I print a label off of Etsy. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy shipping time is inside of each listing in the link under the picture. It varies from time to time but I do have a full time shop assistant and it&#39;s almost always no longer than a week. \r\n\r\nLast but not least, I will have to recharge you if a package is returned to me for insufficient address or any other reason that is not my fault.

I know mistakes happen and if I send you something stamped incorrectly with the wrong information, I will gladly remake the item and ship it at my expense. I will not overnight an item to meet a deadline.\r\n\r\nPLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE read the instructions in each listing. Our prices are super low and if you force me to have to contact you because you failed to read the character limits on a tag, for example, it will eventually force our prices up. We want to remain the place where customer&#39;s can come for a great quality, inexpensive gift or necessary pet id tag when the need arises. I will NOT refund you because of your mistake. I will give you store credit, but will not refund.\r\n\r\nOnce again, I am not responsible for lost or damaged packages. It is up to you, the customer, to request insurance if you feel the need. Please contact me BEFORE an order is placed.\r\n\r\nSince I cut most of my own pieces, I WILL NOT CANCEL AN ORDER unless I haven&#39;t already started preparing it. Each item ordered from DCM Creations is made at time of order. Every morning, I print out my orders and create work trays and prepare a cut list of pieces that I need to fulfill my daily orders. I then send my cut list to my metal cutter each morning. One of my workers gathers the pieces (if they have them ready) and then cuts and deburrs the rest that evening making them ready the following day. If your pieces have already been pulled from stock and/or cut, I will not issue a refund. \r\n\r\nWe put a lot of work into each and every order and we sincerely hope you appreciate the care we put into your handmade items. We don&#39;t just purchase pieces from other vendors and throw something together, we own the machines and dies to cut out each piece and ARE very careful with each piece that we send out that they meet our high expectations.\r\n\r\n",

"title": "Handmade Premium Multi-Wood Guitar Pick - Laser Engraved - Actual Pick Shown - No Stock Photos",
"description": "No stock photos here!  The guitar pick shown is the actual pick you will receive, both sides of the pick are shown, (both sides are engraved), a different design is on each side, see photos. Made with a mix of domestic & exotic hardwoods, Gabon ebony, African leadwood, plum tree wood, & African zebrawood, 4 very beautiful, dense & durable exotic & domestic hardwoods. \nThis premium guitar pick was handcrafted independently, it features a concave thumb groove on each side to ensure a firm grip, & also give the pick an incredible feel of control, the pick also features precision laser engraving with the designs shown, this just adds to the awesome grip that the thumb grooves already provide. \nThe pick measures approx. 1-1/4&quot; or 31 mm long  X  1-1/16&quot; or 26.5 mm wide, it is 3.1 mm thick at the thickest part of the pick, but it feels & plays much thinner due to the concave thumb grooves, the pick tapers down to a thickness of about 1 mm at the tip, & was designed with the guitarist in mind for total comfort & play-ability, the pick is treated with a Danish oil finish, for lasting protection I let the pick soak in the oil to ensure that the pick is deeply penetrated, this is done both before & after the engraving is done, a great all-around guitar pick for use with electric, or acoustic guitars. \nFor some guitarists it may take a while to get used to playing with a wooden pick, but every guitar player that I know, simply can&#39;t live without their hardwood guitar picks once put to the test. So take your guitar playing to new levels, with the unmatched performance, & the true tones that my handmade Artisan wood picks deliver. They also make unique & exceptional gifts!  Thanks for looking!\n\nAbout the woods used...\n\nGABON EBONY - Diospyros Crassiflora - The tree is native to Gabon and grows throughout Southern Nigeria, Cameroon, and Zaire. Gabon Ebony is said to be &quot;the blackest wood in the world,&quot; although it does sometimes contain brown highlights. The wood is quite hard, heavy, and dense, the combination of jet-black appearance and hardness makes it a particular favorite among musical instrument makers , the wood is widely used to make keys for pianos and harpsichords, as well as fingerboards for guitars, violins, cellos, and oboes. Ebony wood has been coveted by wood artisans for literally thousands of years; in fact, some carved pieces have been discovered in Ancient Egyptian tombs. The wood&#39;s distinct coloring and ability to polish beautifully have kept it highly sought after through the ages.\n\nAFRICAN LEADWOOD - Species: Combretum schumanii - Family: Combretaceae \nThe tree is native to South Africa. The heartwood is dark brown, sometimes close to black, with straight to interlocked grain pattern. A very hard, dense and heavy wood with excellent working qualities. Turns and finishes excellent and takes a brilliant polish directly from the tool, and it also has a very nice chatoyance quality. \n\nPlum Tree wood - I do not know the actual genus of the plum tree wood that was used, but the tree which is no longer living, is in my own back yard, It was a big tree that I partially cut up for firewood, the wood was seasoned for over 4 years now, and will make some nice stock for more guitar picks, if i don&#39;t use it all first for some tasty bar-b-que cooking wood!\n\nZEBRAWOOD - Microberlina Brazzavillensis - Tree is Native to Africa. It grows primarily on the river banks of West Africa. This beautiful exotic hardwood is pale golden brown to pinkish-brown with pronounced dark brown streaks giving the quartered surfaces a zebra-stripe appearance. The grain is interlocked. This wood has a coarse texture and lustrous surface. Zebrawood is not only very beautiful, but is also heavy, hard, and strong.\n\nGP-1447",

"title": "Handmade Premium Wood Guitar Pick - Afzelia Xylay - Actual Pick Shown - No Stock Photos",
"description": "No stock photos here!  The guitar pick shown is the actual pick you will receive, both sides are shown, (both sides are engraved), the same Dad design is on each side, see photos. Made of Afzelia Xylay, a very beautiful, dense & durable exotic hardwood. \nThis premium guitar pick was meticulously handcrafted independently, it features a concave thumb groove on each side to ensure a firm grip, & also give the pick an incredible feel of control, the laser engraving just adds to the awesome grip that the thumb grooves already provide. \nThe pick measures approx. 1-1/4&quot; or 31.3 mm long  X  just over 1&quot; or 26.1 mm wide, it is 3.3 mm thick at the thickest part of the pick, but it feels & plays much thinner due to the rough sanded concave thumb grooves, the pick tapers down to a thickness of about 1 mm at the tip, & was designed with the guitarist in mind for total comfort & play-ability, the pick is treated with a Danish oil finish, for lasting protection I let the pick soak in the oil to ensure that the pick is deeply penetrated, this is done both before & after the engraving is done, a great all-around guitar pick for use with acoustic, or electric guitars.\nFor some guitarists it may take a while to get used to playing with a wooden pick, but every guitar player that I know, simply can&#39;t live without their hardwood guitar picks once put to the test. So take your guitar playing to new levels, with the unmatched performance, & the true tones that my handmade Artisan wood picks deliver. They also make unique & exceptional gifts!  Thanks for looking!\n\nAbout the wood used...\n\nAFZELIA XYLAY – (Afzelia xylocarpa) - The tree is native to Southeast Asia, & grows throughout Cambodia, Laos,Thailand. Vietnam, & Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. This species of wood can exhibit incredible figure, and is also known as alligator skin, a relatively dense wood that can range in color from yellowish orange, to tan & brown, and sometimes very dark brown to nearly black streaks running through it. This wood can very easily trick the eye into thinking that the wood is somewhat rough, while being glassy smooth, a truly unique & beautiful exotic wood.\n\nGP-1457",

Once an order has been submitted, the shipping address cannot be changed if it is different than the billing address. You may cancel the existing order, provided that it has not been processed for shipping, and place a new order with a different shipping destination. \r\n\r\nIf item is returned to OnePickPony due to address issues, the customer will be responsible to pay postage prior to shipping to a corrected address.  OnePickPony uses an automatic labelling system which uses the address customer provided.\r\n\r\n Tracking is not available for out of country shipping. While not the norm, overseas shipping can take up to six weeks. You will be emailed a customs number upon shipment.  I can only show proof of mailing for out of country orders and cannot be held responsible for any shipping problems. To ensure timely delivery and tracking, it is always advised to use Priority shipping.\r\n\r\n In accordance with the law, all international orders will have full value declared on customs forms. Import duties, VAT taxes, and charges are NOT included in the item price or shipping cost, as these charges are the buyer&#39;s responsibility. We recommend checking with your country&#39;s customs office to determine what additional costs will be prior to buying.

Refunds will only be given upon return of item.   On custom orders character amounts vary from piece to piece and item may not be able to set up exactly as shown in pictures or as requested; OnePickPony will do so at their discretion to make the item most attractive. \r\n\r\nAbsolutely no refunds, for any reason, after 30 days of shipping. \r\n\r\nOnePickPony is not responsible for any item not received if shown delivered by the USPS nor non-delivered international orders.",

"title": "Professional Custom Engraved Guitar Pick / Plectrum. African Ebony wood. Felt gift bag included.",
"description": "Professional custom engraved guitar pick. African ebony wood. Free hand-stitched felt keyring holder.\n\nWe custom engrave Timber Tones guitar picks, a British leader in the industry, because of their incredible quality and eco-friendly ethics. These are not cheap picks that break easily, they are a professional standard used in the music world. We then laser engrave at 600dpi for absolute precision and clarity.\n\nHOW TO BUY:\n\na) Choose to engrave either one or both sides of your pick (we suggest no more than 7 or 8 words per side, ideally 4-7).\n- &#39;One side&#39; means the reverse is kept blank.\n- &#39;Both sides&#39; means you can have either the same or a different message on each side.\nb) Add your engraving as a &#39;Note to CustomMusicGifts&#39; during checkout.\n\nCalisto MT font is used - it is a medium thickness serif font that looks and engraves excellently, as seen in the examples. The pick has a flat thumb area on both sides, enabling a comfortable grip and serving as the area for engraving.\n\n----------------------\n\nAfrican Ebony is an extremely hard wood with a very close grained timber that polishes to a smooth finish, ensuring a clean crisp sound. It is also the wood of choice for many guitar manufacturers, who use its pure black appearance to manufacture finger boards, bridge pins and machine head buttons.\n\nThe wood is obtained from the Diospyros Mespilifomis tree, a large deciduous tree found mostly in the savannas of Africa.\n\nRECOMMENDED FOR:\n- Electric guitar\n- Acoustic guitar (dramatic brightening)\n\nALSO CONSIDER:\n- Lignum Vitae: https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/192898849/custom-engraved-guitar-pick-plectrum\n\n\n----------------------\n\nCHOOSING THE RIGHT PICK:\nCustom pick section: https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/CustomMusicGifts?section_id=15608540\n\nAcoustic guitar:\nEbony (dramatic brightening)\nBuffalo Bone (strong brightening)\nBeech and Ebony Combo (strong brightening)\nMother of Pearl (black) (medium brightening)\nMother of Pearl (red) (medium brightening)\nJatoba (medium brightening)\nAfrican Sapele (medium brightening)\nCocobolo (medium brightening)\nBloodwood (subtle brightening)\nAfrican Mahogany (nylon strung)\nSantos Rosewood (Blues and Jazz)\n\nBass guitar:\nLignum Vitae\nEbony (shredding)\n\nClassical guitar:\nCocobolo\nAfrican Mahogany\n\nElectric guitar:\nEbony\nBloodwood\nSantos Rosewood\nJatoba (Blues and Jazz)\nBeech and Ebony Combo\nMother of Pearl (black)\nMother of Pearl (red)\nAnodised Aluminium (black)\nAnodised Aluminium (red)\nBuffalo Bone",

Please note that Canadian and international locations take longer than US orders.\r\nIf it has been longer than the time mentioned, check the tracking number on your order and contact your local post office.  Talk to your neighbors or friends to see if they might have it.  If not, contact me and we will discuss getting you a new item.\r\n\r\n**Tracking on Canadian/International Orders will appear &quot;frozen&quot; after they reach a large city in the United States where they ship internationally from, such as Los Angeles.

If the font you&#39;d like is not in the option dropdown when you add it to your cart, it&#39;s because it doesn&#39;t fit. If you have questions, please let me know!\r\n\r\n✤ Where can I see all your design stamps?\r\nThey&#39;re shown here: https://img0.etsystatic.com/038/0/5739679/il_570xN.631928186_5vpe.jpg\r\n\r\n✤ How do I personalize?\r\nAdd the item to your cart.\r\nPut the name, crystal color, etc... in the Note to DistinctlyIvy.\r\n\r\n✤ How do I order multiple necklaces?\r\nAdd one to your cart, then change the quantity to what you would like.\r\n\r\n✤ Do you offer a discount on multiple items?\r\nYes, I offer a 10% discount on 10 or more of the same items, purchased at the same time, sent to the same location.  This is 10% total and might be reduced if items are already on sale.  I offer 15% on 20 or more of the same items, same terms as just mentioned.  Please contact me to discuss receiving the discount!\r\n\r\n✤ When will my order ship?\r\nUnless I&#39;ve stated a different shipping time at the top of my page under my shop banner (usually only during the holidays), I ship out next business day!  Yes, that includes all personalization. :)\r\n\r\n✤ What&#39;s the difference between ball and cable chain?\r\nCable is here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/115259822/silver-copper-or-bronze-cable-chain-14?ref=shop_home_active\r\nBall chain is here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/127651589/ball-beaded-chain-silver-copper-or?ref=shop_home_active\r\n\r\n✤ Can you stamp on the back of the discs?\r\nNo, sorry, I can&#39;t stamp on the back of any of my discs. We could probably add another disc, though, from my add-on section: https://www.etsy.com/shop/DistinctlyIvy?section_id=12307631\r\n\r\n✤ Can I add on another disc or crystal?  \r\nYes, you probably can - check first in the item description to be sure it doesn&#39;t mention add-ons.  I usually put the corresponding add-on in the description.  If not, check here for all my add-ons: https://www.etsy.com/shop/DistinctlyIvy?section_id=12307631\r\n\r\n✤ Can you add on more than 6 or 12 crystals on your Grandma necklaces?\r\nYes, I can add more, but they will not hang from the middle if you are buying a washer necklace - they will hang off the chain, slightly off to the side.\r\nAlso, with a large domed necklace, please know that the crystals may fall off easier if you add more than 12 to a necklace.\r\nIf you&#39;d like more, you can buy the add-on crystals here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/99312994/crystal-or-pearl-add-on-to-handstamped?ref=shop_home_active\r\n\r\n✤ What are your discs and chain made of?\r\nThe discs are nickel silver and the chain is silver plated.  They last great as long as you don&#39;t wear them in a pool or in the shower.\r\n\r\n✤ What lengths do you suggest for children?\r\n14 inches for age 4 and under\r\n16 inches for age 5-18\r\n18 inches - most popular size for women\r\n\r\n✤ ✤ I hope this helps! If you have more questions, feel free to email me  at distinctlyivy@gmail.com or message me on Etsy.  Thanks so much and we&#39;re looking forward to helping you find a personalized item that&#39;s absolutely perfect.✤ ✤ ",

"policy_shipping": "I try to keep shipping as low as possible.  If your shipping is more than what I pay - I will refund the difference.  Please let me know in the invoice notes.\r\n\r\nMy shipping charges reflect the cost of packaging, postage and fees.\r\n\r\nI strive to mail out all items purchased within 4 business days(Monday-Friday). During the RUSH months of September through December it may take up to 10 days to prepare your order.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me if you need a rush order. We will do our best to help you out.  We are unable to fill RUSH orders during the BUSY season.\r\n\r\nI SHIP TO THE ADDRESS ON Your Paypal Account! Please make sure it is correct. If you want it shipped elsewhere, please leave a MESSAGE in the INVOICE NOTES. \r\n\r\nTracking your Package - US Priority Packages are trackable.\r\n\r\nInternational Packages are only TRACKABLE if they are sent EXPRESS MAIL which is $27.00 for the small box.\r\n\r\n*Note* I don&#39;t intend to make money from shipping. However, shipping costs vary from state to state and country to country, etc. I have tried to set up my shipping costs using an average of all places I ship to. It can be tricky to estimate shipping, especially out of the United States. Larger orders may be more expensive than your invoice states.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL ORDERS\r\nIn our experience, the following countries hold packages for 1-2 weeks in customs or commonly lose them in transport:  I would advise requesting insurance for these countries:\r\n\r\nCANADA\r\nGERMANY\r\nSPAIN\r\n\r\nFirst Class is cheaper and does not get held up in customs as often as more expensive shipping choices.  But this is not trackable.\r\n\r\nIf a package is lost, we do our best to help locate your package or send a replacement.\r\n\r\nPlease don&#39;t be afraid to ask any questions you may have in this regard!**\r\n\r\n***I always send out invoices with orders, this helps us all keep better records and confirm that you&#39;ve received what you ordered.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nLiz",

Scratched blanks cannot be refunded because they cannot be resold.\r\n\r\nAny packages, such as rivets, setter kits and some tools -  where the package is sealed at the factory can only be returned if the package is unopened.\r\n\r\n***We will only accept these items as returned if there was a problem with the product.\r\n\r\n2 - Include your invoice letting us know that you would like a Refund.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we receive your items we will refund the price of the blanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n******REFUNDS will be made only after the items are returned in good condition and within 30 days of the date of purchase.",
"policy_additional": "Here&#39;s a run down of the different types of aluminum I have available:\r\n\r\nPURE 1100 ALUMINUM \r\nMy favorite.  It is FOOD SAFE and safe on your skin.  A perfect choice for projects that will come in direct contact with your skin. There are less skin reactions with FOOD SAFE ALUMINUM, than with STERLING SILVER.. \r\n\r\nIt&#39;s available in \r\nSOFT TEMPER \r\nVery soft and great for metal stamping.  Thick cuffs are easy to bend with the SOFT Temper.  It takes a very clear impression and is very gently on your tools.\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\nHARD TEMPER \r\nStiff metal that will not bend out of shape.  I use the HARD TEMPER for all charms and discs\r\n\r\n************************\r\n\r\n3003 ALUMINUM - stronger but not as pure.  THIS METAL IS MEANT TO BE COVERED OR FINISHED IN SOME WAY BEFORE BEING WORN.\r\n***This is great for covering with fabric or as a BASE for POLYMER clay.\r\n\r\nHope this helps you decide what metal is best for your aluminum discs, aluminum cuffs, or ring blanks at Gotta Getta Deal on ETSY!!!\r\n\r\nHave fun creating!!!\r\nLiz",
